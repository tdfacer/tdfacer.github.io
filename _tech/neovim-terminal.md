## Documentation

`:h terminal`

## NeoVim Terminal

Sometimes it is useful to open a terminal emulator within your neovim session. This can be done with the `:terminal` command. This will open a terminal emulator in a new buffer. You can then use the terminal emulator as you would any other terminal emulator. You can run commands, navigate the buffer, etc.

### Commands

* `<C-\><C-n>`: Exit terminal mode and return to normal mode.
